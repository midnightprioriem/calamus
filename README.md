<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

Calamus is a React Electron application for writing and publishing novels.

<!-- Features -->
### :dart: Features

Calamus is currently still in pre-alpha stages---not all features are available. For a feature roadmap, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/midnightprioriem/calamus/projects/2" target="_blank">Project Board</a>.

#### üñäÔ∏è Write Your Next Novel

Calamus has what you need to organize and write your next novel. Organize your project into folders and use Markdown to make writing a breeze.

#### üëê Open Format

Calamus stores all of your project data in a human readable json format. In addition, all book content is written using Markdown, making all of your work truly portable. You can export all of your book's content into markdown files at any time.

##### .cala Format

<details>

Calamus project files use the `.cala` file extension, but are really just `json` files (yes this means you can edit `.cala` files by hand, but it is not recommended!). See below for a table detailing the properties inside of a `.cala` file.
